That was when four Computer Science undergraduates at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA launched this company with no capital apart from a single Pentium 100 web server (Destro was her name), using shared bandwidth on a T1 line that a friend gave us at no cost. By necessity we had to be frugal, but even with our less than ample resources we always did our best to provide a quality service at a reasonable price.
